*  Node is a runtime for JavaScript that allows you to run JavaScript, which is usually run ont he browser, on the machine. It takes the frontend language, JS, and turns it into a backend language, which enables us to make servers ready for client request. It is also asynchronous JavaScript, meaning it is non-blocking. It will execute code depending on whichever line of code it fastest. This makes it a fast runtime. Express is a module or library that can be imported into a Node.js file, allowing a progrommer access to all of the methods available in the express library. 

What is their relationship?

*  Express is a library that can be downloaded as an npm package and used in writing JavaScript.

"Fast unopinionated, minimalist"-- what do these words mean?
